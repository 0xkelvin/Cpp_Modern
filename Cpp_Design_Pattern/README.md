# Cpp_Design_Pattern

Original 23 patterns in three categories: 
- Creational : object instantiation
- Structural : class relationships and hieraches
- Behavioral : object intercommunication

1. Creational:
the goal of creation design pattern is to efficiently create objects in a way that increases the flexibility and reuse of existing code.
it does it by moving the creation of objects out of the main code and into separate classes. Thereby, encapsulating it.
the main code would no longer have explicit references to concrete classes and their instantiation.
